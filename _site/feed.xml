            <title>Key Biscayne</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I want to say about Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne is that it is literally the best overall  resort experience we have ever had and the only place we have visited more than any other. Moreover, this place will always hold a special place in our hearts since this became our go to destination for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries during the time we were juggling our long distance relationship between continents. &amp;lt;1 more line&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/beach_chill.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had always wanted to visit the Miami area and we stumbled upon this place called Key Biscayne, an island town which is a fifteen minute drive away from the city of Miami and a thirty minute drive from the well known South Beach Area. Just like first time tourists, we were ready to book our South Beach vacation but something about the Ritz-Carlton at Key Biscayne felt just right to us and we booked it, which in hindsight was one of the best travel decisions we have taken, and actually made us listen to our gut more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/beach_entrance.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive, once you leave the city of Miami and cross the bridge to enter Key Biscayne, is beautiful and relaxing, with the sun shining brightly and the road flanked by state parks and golf courses. Once the green clears, emerges a small town which embodies a relaxed yet modern approach to its way of life. Not far into your travels within this town rests its centrepiece, the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne. You can’t miss it, take that left turn and get lost in the perfect balance of tranquility, fun and luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/road.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we had one word to describe our introduction to this place through the entrance, it would definitely be ‘impressive’. More impressive was the fact that when we visited this place again a year later, we were welcomed by the bell staff saying “It’s great to have you AGAIN”. As soon as you enter the property, the first thing you witness is a huge window right in front of you, through which you can see the massive body of water which flanks the beach, while you are standing in an enormous lobby enamoured by the typical Ritz-Carlton fragrance refreshing you. It feels like a vacation as soon as you walk in. As we checked in and entered our room some chocolate covered strawberries and champagne awaited us along with a note congratulating us on our celebrations. What a great start already. Now all we had to do was order some comfort food, sip on the champagne while enjoying the amazing view from our room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/celeb.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/view1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our favourite thing to do while at the property is to just relax and enjoy the luxury. The hotel has two pools and a private beach area which is just a stone’s throw away. If you want to enjoy a quite swim you can hang out by the adult pool, we however become such kids in a pool that we prefer and love hanging out by the family pool and would keep switching between the pool and the beach. While in the pool you can order for yourself some delicious cocktails or chilled beers to beat the heat. Our favourite cocktails there are the Mojito Cubano and The Vice! Enjoying some swim time and having cocktails delivered to you without having to leave the pool is pure luxury. Also you can either lounge around on the pool chairs or reserve yourself a private cabana that even has a mini fridge in it to keep your beverages chilled throughout the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/pool_chill.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides this the hotel’s pathway also leads you directly to the beach where you can indulge in activities such as canoeing and sailing on a hobbie cat. Or you can simply ask a pool &amp;amp; beach staff to set you up with some beach chairs and shade and you can further order some food and drinks to enjoy lounging by the beach. Also if you are visiting around the months of May thorough October you can experience turtle nesting and hatching of their eggs and sites of baby turtles entering the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/beach_act.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/turtle.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ritz-Carlton, Key Biscayne also offers a wide range of dining options from fine dining to casual oceanfront restaurants. For lunch we prefer these two restaurants: Cantina Beach and Dune Burgers on the Beach. The former is a perfect oceanfront restaurant with yummy Mexican cuisine and a large collection of tequila (perfect for tequila lovers), while Dune Burgers on the Beach is for those who crave some comfort food like their gourmet burgers and enjoy their extensive collection of champagne and wines. For breakfast we usually head out to this family owned and operated diner that is there since 1992 called The Donut Gallery Diner. The place is very small but has that old school charm, the food is cooked as in a typical diner just a few yards away from you and served hot! The food tastes fantastic, freshly squeezed OJ and unlimited coffee are a delight, moreover does not put a damper on your pocket and is only about a seven minute drive form the hotel. Also when we are craving for some Indian cuisine another restaurant we like to go to for lunch or dinner at least once during our stay is Ayesha Saffron Indian Restaurant again only about a five minute drive from the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/breakfast1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/breakfast2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we love lounging around at the hotel and enjoying the luxuries Ritz-Carlton has to offer we still enjoy exploring other areas. The best way to get around is renting your own car. There are several rental companies at the airport you can get the pricing and offers and choose the one that suits you best, although booking online well in advance will help you save some more. For convenience, there is Hertz car rental on the property who can help you out with the rentals. One tip: Choose your drop off location to be the airport that way you don’t have to spend extra for the cab and try to book your vehicle online even though the rental place is on property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For off property experiences, of course there are the usual spots such as South Beach or even Key West, which is around a 3 hour drive from Key Biscayne, but we came across this small town called Key Largo, which is about an hour drive from the property and is a great little overlooked spot for snorkelling and water sports. We had our very first snorkelling experience here and it was absolutely magical(since it was our first time), and later on had an amazing jet ski ride with literally no one else in sight in front of us, only the big blue ocean and we could ride as far and as fast as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/kb/snorkel.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From laying in the pool sipping mojitos, having a long relaxing evening walk on a private beach, indulging in mouth watering delicacies, swimming with the fish and riding along the waves, to finally relaxing on our balcony on a warm sunny afternoon, gazing over the vast ocean in front of us capped a perfect four day weekend for us and kept us wanting for more. Needless to say, we were back the next year for more and will be on every chance we get. This place is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Aruba</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;“Aruba Welcome to Happiness” is the sign you see as you get out of the airplane and walk towards the airport.  As you have read that line and have been hearing the stories from people on the plane of their visits year after year, you begin to wonder what draws people here repeatedly and why the island is nicknamed “One Happy Island”. As you work your way through the airport formalities you are greeted and assisted by warm &amp;amp; friendly people and as soon as you step out, fresh cool breeze welcomes you while the sun brightly shines upon you. You begin to see the glimpse of the tag line in these few minutes of being in Aruba. Now that your luggage is loaded in the trunk of the taxi and you have your sunglasses on, you are all set to explore the “happiness”. You cant wait to get a close glimpse of that glistening turquoise Caribbean water that you saw from above as your flight landed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/aruba.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as you move ahead you enter the island’s capital city Oranjestad. And if you are some one who loves shopping you have already found your happiness. This area provides you with varied shopping options where you can indulge in luxury high end shopping or pick up a beautiful inexpensive souvenir from the shops near the wharf while enjoying the view of massive cruise ships and private yachts docked in front of you. Further add some sparkle to your wardrobe by visiting the many gold and diamond merchants in that area or get on a colourful hop-on hop-off tram that takes you to Main Street, where the locals shop and while you are shopping and walking in the shadow of pretty palm trees on both side of the street, taste some local snacks from the eateries in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/downtown.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a water baby just like us, your dose of happy is yet to be received. As you drive ahead you finally see stretches of beautiful beaches with turquoise waters and white sand so soft that you would want to walk barefoot all day long. Now all you need to do is just spread your mat, lay under the palapas, sip on some Aruba Aribas, read your favourite book, listen to or play music all this while getting that perfect tan. (Caution: Remember to use sunscreen though as the sun can get pretty hot). Now that you have basked enough in the sun it is time to cool off and take a dip in the clear waters that will refresh you in no time. Our favourite site while swimming is watching the stork graciously dive not very far away from us in search of food. You can literally do this on a loop: tan, dive, sip cocktails, REPEAT! We do it and absolutely enjoy it! Few of our other sites while hanging out at the beach or strolling is watching the catamaran sail across the horizon, kids building sand castles; and during sunset hour on one side, watching the big fiery ball setting and becoming one with the ocean and on the other, seeing couples exchange vows and doing wedding photoshoots while others proposing to their better halves to start a new chapter of their life. (if you are planning a beach wedding this is your place!) There is just so much positivity and happy vibes on the island that you cannot help but fall in love with the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/beach.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/beachbird.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the stretch of these beautiful beaches are also several stay options ranging from budget hotels to luxury resorts. Now that Aruba’s world class beaches and absolutely perfect sunbathing spots have you relaxed and rejuvenated, it is time to get that adrenaline pumping. There are several activities on this very strip of Palm Beach to satiate that daredevil in you. You can wander off in the ocean on a jet ski or fly high while parasailing and enjoy the shades of blue from the top. You can explore the colourful and rich marine life, corals and even see a turtle swim by if you are lucky while snorkelling at several spots on the the island. You can also dive off into the ocean and see the spectacular German shipwreck from World War II. You can even try your hand at kite surfing, wind surfing, fly boarding or even jump off a plane if you dare to (We are still building up that courage to try sky diving in our future travels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/snorkelfish.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/snorkel.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure about you all but after all these activities our stomach certainly starts to growl. Aruba is also a paradise for all you foodies out there. In addition to the lip smacking local Aruban cuisine and sea food, there are variety of restaurants offering various cuisines such as Italian, Argentinian, Mexican, Oriental, Indian and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island’s nightlife is also quite buzzing with various night clubs that help you groove to anything from salsa, bachata, merengue, to pop music and much more. Each year around the months of January- February, the island also gets in the spirit of the Carnival season. During carnival you get to enjoy sights of huge colourfully decorated floats and costumes, loud music, and days of celebration where the people of the island come together to create that electrifying ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/carnaval.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aruba is 19.6 miles long and 6 miles across with a total area of 70 miles and yet it has so much to offer to all it’s travellers. There is something for everybody and for all age groups. No wonder Aruba is called “One Happy Island”, how can it not be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine this was just a glimpse of happiness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#trotwithus to explore and experience more of this island’s happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing off and sending across happy vibes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Love&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/authors/us.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there trotters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Harshita &amp;amp; Aman! Kindergarten sweethearts who at the age of 19 had said to each other that we would not marry anyone and just travel the world as best friends. Well one thing changed, we ended up marrying each other but two things that remained constant are that we are still best friends and are travelling the world together.
What kind of travelers are we?
We love nature, fresh air, peace and quiet and we enjoy staying between mountains and lots of greenery. However when it comes to nature we are a bit partial towards beach destinations as we are absolute water babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/authors/harshita.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harshita&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 16 I went from being a city girl to an island girl. I moved to this beautiful island in the Caribbean called Aruba that I call home and that is poles apart from Mumbai, India. But that is the best thing about traveling, it shows you new ways of life and changes the way you think. I am a major in International Tourism Management and from the hospitality industry. So yes! My education, work and desire all link back to tourism and traveling. I strongly believe that the experiences you gain while traveling and exploring new places are something that no one can ever take away from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/authors/aman.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Much to learn you still have — Yoda&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! I am a Star Wars fanatic and together with my favourite travel partner, I plan on, well, not ruling the galaxy but travelling the world! I will always believe in that quote and the form in which I learn the best is opening myself up to new experiences and different ways of life through travel. 
I am a proud NYU Alumni and apart from traveling and writing, I am passionate towards technology and you can always find me reading about or tinkering with any new developments in technology, be it physical or code. Also, I am a huge movie buff and the idea that a movie can transport the viewer to a completely different world for a few hours sounds absolutely fascinating to me.
What traveling means to me is pure happiness. Ever since I was little, my answer to people’s “what do you want to do when you grow up” question would be to travel and see all the places in the world (and one day space maybe). The world is a beautiful and amazing place and my dream has always been to explore, create memories and have adventures all over, at every chance I get. And along the way, I have been fortunate enough to have found the perfect partner to be able to share my adventure with.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New York, New York</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a cold, windy night; the stars are out to guide me. I don’t know where I’m going, but I still have a faint idea I do. How can you get lost in such a marvel of mankind. Walking on a gravelled path with the river rippling just beside my feet, completely in awe of a humungous span of concrete soaring above me, with the sound of a thousand motors whizzing in unison. Maybe this is what flying cars would feel like in the future. I continue on my path, completely wrapping myself up in wool. A gentle wind is blowing, bringing along with it the first few snowflakes of the season, and of my entire life. Before you know it, the lights seem brighter, the wind feels cooler, all the faces around me look happier; and I’m surrounded by my very own winter wonderland!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.’ - J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/nyc.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, New York City is the city that never sleeps, the place where you go to grind it out and do something with your life. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. All of the aforementioned is true, but among the rigour and within the battle, this place exudes a charm and makes you fall in love with it like no other. There are very few places on earth which can do that, but this is unlike anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can get this feeling, you need to earn it. Day in and day out you need to live it. From walking on a crowded street surrounded by buildings as tall as the eye can see, in complete awe of the scale and the feeling that this place is like no other; to taking a subway ride home over the Manhattan bridge in the evening, taking a step back from all the madness and watching the sun set over the picturesque skyline, drowning out the sounds of the city and adding that very moment to the list of ever-lasting experiences accrued over time in this unexplainable, unbelievable phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But New York City is not a magical utopia. In fact, far from it, it is as dark and gritty and tough as anything can get. To survive in such a place requires a special kind of heart because it will beat you up and knock you down at every chance it gets. Not everyone can like or even survive this city, but for those who do, they claim to come out reinvented after this experience. The city shapes you as a person and instills qualities within you, worthy of its own high expectations. The place is excellent, and excellence is what it demands from its people, and once you’ve been bitten by the bug, no dream is too big, no idea is too small and you will be ready to take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This city will always be the place where I have grown up and rediscovered my childhood. It will always be responsible for me being the person I am today and my perpetual quest  and appreciation of the exceptional and the extraordinary. It is difficult to describe how much this city means to me, but every single day, every single moment spent trotting about here has been life-changing and truly special. Treat it like an old friend, give it your time and your patience, your integrity and your appreciation, stick by it and its people, and in return you will be rewarded with memories to last an entire lifetime. I know I have.&lt;/p&gt;
