            <title>Aruba</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;“Aruba Welcome to Happiness” is the sign you see as you get out of the airplane and walk towards the airport.  As you have read that line and have been hearing the stories from people on the plane of their visits year after year, you begin to wonder what draws people here repeatedly and why the island is nicknamed “One Happy Island”. As you work your way through the airport formalities you are greeted and assisted by warm &amp;amp; friendly people and as soon as you step out, fresh cool breeze welcomes you while the sun brightly shines upon you. You begin to see the glimpse of the tag line in these few minutes of being in Aruba. Now that your luggage is loaded in the trunk of the taxi and you have your sunglasses on, you are all set to explore the “happiness”. You cant wait to get a close glimpse of that glistening turquoise Caribbean water that you saw from above as your flight landed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/aruba.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as you move ahead you enter the island’s capital city Oranjestad. And if you are some one who loves shopping you have already found your happiness. This area provides you with varied shopping options where you can indulge in luxury high end shopping or pick up a beautiful inexpensive souvenir from the shops near the wharf while enjoying the view of massive cruise ships and private yachts docked in front of you. Further add some sparkle to your wardrobe by visiting the many gold and diamond merchants in that area or get on a colourful hop-on hop-off tram that takes you to Main Street, where the locals shop and while you are shopping and walking in the shadow of pretty palm trees on both side of the street, taste some local snacks from the eateries in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/downtown.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a water baby just like us, your dose of happy is yet to be received. As you drive ahead you finally see stretches of beautiful beaches with turquoise waters and white sand so soft that you would want to walk barefoot all day long. Now all you need to do is just spread your mat, lay under the palapas, sip on some Aruba Aribas, read your favourite book, listen to or play music all this while getting that perfect tan. (Caution: Remember to use sunscreen though as the sun can get pretty hot). Now that you have basked enough in the sun it is time to cool off and take a dip in the clear waters that will refresh you in no time. Our favourite site while swimming is watching the stork graciously dive not very far away from us in search of food. You can literally do this on a loop: tan, dive, sip cocktails, REPEAT! We do it and absolutely enjoy it! Few of our other sites while hanging out at the beach or strolling is watching the catamaran sail across the horizon, kids building sand castles; and during sunset hour on one side, watching the big fiery ball setting and becoming one with the ocean and on the other, seeing couples exchange vows and doing wedding photoshoots while others proposing to their better halves to start a new chapter of their life. (if you are planning a beach wedding this is your place!) There is just so much positivity and happy vibes on the island that you cannot help but fall in love with the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/beach.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/beachbird.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the stretch of these beautiful beaches are also several stay options ranging from budget hotels to luxury resorts. Now that Aruba’s world class beaches and absolutely perfect sunbathing spots have you relaxed and rejuvenated, it is time to get that adrenaline pumping. There are several activities on this very strip of Palm Beach to satiate that daredevil in you. You can wander off in the ocean on a jet ski or fly high while parasailing and enjoy the shades of blue from the top. You can explore the colourful and rich marine life, corals and even see a turtle swim by if you are lucky while snorkelling at several spots on the the island. You can also dive off into the ocean and see the spectacular German shipwreck from World War II. You can even try your hand at kite surfing, wind surfing, fly boarding or even jump off a plane if you dare to (We are still building up that courage to try sky diving in our future travels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/snorkelfish.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/snorkel.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure about you all but after all these activities our stomach certainly starts to growl. Aruba is also a paradise for all you foodies out there. In addition to the lip smacking local Aruban cuisine and sea food, there are variety of restaurants offering various cuisines such as Italian, Argentinian, Mexican, Oriental, Indian and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island’s nightlife is also quite buzzing with various night clubs that help you groove to anything from salsa, bachata, merengue, to pop music and much more. Each year around the months of January- February, the island also gets in the spirit of the Carnival season. During carnival you get to enjoy sights of huge colourfully decorated floats and costumes, loud music, and days of celebration where the people of the island come together to create that electrifying ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/aruba/carnaval.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aruba is 19.6 miles long and 6 miles across with a total area of 70 miles and yet it has so much to offer to all it’s travellers. There is something for everybody and for all age groups. No wonder Aruba is called “One Happy Island”, how can it not be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine this was just a glimpse of happiness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#trotwithus to explore and experience more of this island’s happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing off and sending across happy vibes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Love&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/authors/us.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there trotters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Harshita &amp;amp; Aman! Kindergarten sweethearts who at the age of 19 had said to each other that we would not marry anyone and just travel the world as best friends. Well one thing changed, we ended up marrying each other but two things that remained constant are that we are still best friends and are travelling the world together.
What kind of travelers are we?
We love nature, fresh air, peace and quiet and we enjoy staying between mountains and lots of greenery. However when it comes to nature we are a bit partial towards beach destinations as we are absolute water babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/authors/harshita.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harshita&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 16 I went from being a city girl to an island girl. I moved to this beautiful island in the Caribbean called Aruba that I call home and that is poles apart from Mumbai, India. But that is the best thing about traveling, it shows you new ways of life and changes the way you think. I am a major in International Tourism Management and from the hospitality industry. So yes! My education, work and desire all link back to tourism and traveling. I strongly believe that the experiences you gain while traveling and exploring new places is something that no one can ever take away from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/authors/aman.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Much to learn you still have — Yoda&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! I am a Star Wars fanatic and together with my favourite travel partner, I plan on, well, not ruling the galaxy but travelling the world! I will always believe in that quote and the form in which I learn the best is opening myself up to new experiences and different ways of life through travel. 
I am a proud NYU Alumni and apart from traveling and writing, I am passionate towards technology and you can always find me reading about or tinkering with any new developments in technology, be it physical or code. Also, I am a huge movie buff and the idea that a movie can transport the viewer to a completely different world for a few hours sounds absolutely fascinating to me.
What traveling means to me is pure happiness. Ever since I was little, my answer to people’s “what do you want to do when you grow up” question would be to travel and see all the places in the world (and one day space maybe). The world is a beautiful and amazing place and my dream has always been to explore, create memories and have adventures all over, at every chance I get. And along the way, I have been fortunate enough to have found the perfect partner to be able to share my adventure with.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New York, New York</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a cold, windy night; the stars are out to guide me. I don’t know where I’m going, but I still have a faint idea I do. How can you get lost in such a marvel of mankind. Walking on a gravelled path with the river rippling just beside my feet, completely in awe of a humungous span of concrete soaring above me, with the sound of a thousand motors whizzing in unison. Maybe this is what flying cars would feel like in the future. I continue on my path, completely wrapping myself up in wool. A gentle wind is blowing, bringing along with it the first few snowflakes of the season, and of my entire life. Before you know it, the lights seem brighter, the wind feels cooler, all the faces around me look happier; and I’m surrounded by my very own winter wonderland!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.’ - J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/nyc.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, New York City is the city that never sleeps, the place where you go to grind it out and do something with your life. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. All of the aforementioned is true, but among the rigour and within the battle, this place exudes a charm and makes you fall in love with it like no other. There are very few places on earth which can do that, but this is unlike anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can get this feeling, you need to earn it. Day in and day out you need to live it. From walking on a crowded street surrounded by buildings as tall as the eye can see, in complete awe of the scale and the feeling that this place is like no other; to taking a subway ride home over the Manhattan bridge in the evening, taking a step back from all the madness and watching the sun set over the picturesque skyline, drowning out the sounds of the city and adding that very moment to the list of ever-lasting experiences accrued over time in this unexplainable, unbelievable phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But New York City is not a magical utopia. In fact, far from it, it is as dark and gritty and tough as anything can get. To survive in such a place requires a special kind of heart because it will beat you up and knock you down at every chance it gets. Not everyone can like or even survive this city, but for those who do, they claim to come out reinvented after this experience. The city shapes you as a person and instills qualities within you, worthy of its own high expectations. The place is excellent, and excellence is what it demands from its people, and once you’ve been bitten by the bug, no dream is too big, no idea is too small and you will be ready to take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This city will always be the place where I have grown up and rediscovered my childhood. It will always be responsible for me being the person I am today and my perpetual quest  and appreciation of the exceptional and the extraordinary. It is difficult to describe how much this city means to me, but every single day, every single moment spent trotting about here has been life-changing and truly special. Treat it like an old friend, give it your time and your patience, your integrity and your appreciation, stick by it and its people, and in return you will be rewarded with memories to last an entire lifetime. I know I have.&lt;/p&gt;
